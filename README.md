# PROJEKT - A project management app	WIP

This was built following a web-crunch [tutorial](https://web-crunch.com/posts/lets-build-with-ruby-on-rails-project-management-app) that is a few years old now. I updated to the latest Rails 5.2 , as it's been a while since I've done a project in 5.

Frontend: Vue
Auth: Devise with the confirmable option (mail is caught in dev using mailcatcher)
Database: PostgreSQL
